With [Upptime](https://upptime.js.org), you can get your own unlimited and free uptime monitor and status page, powered entirely by a GitHub repository. We use [Issues](https://github.com/s0m1in/Monitor-website-uptime/issues) as incident reports, [Actions](https://github.com/s0m1in/Monitor-website-uptime/actions) as uptime monitors, and [Pages](https://s0m1in.github.io/Monitor-website-uptime) for the status page.
